# Configuration for MATH-500 dataset sampling with Qwen/QwQ-32B model

# Model configuration
model:
  name: "Qwen/QwQ-32B"  # Qwen reasoning model
  temperature: 0.7  # Sampling temperature (0.0-2.0, higher = more random)
  max_tokens: 4096  # Maximum tokens to generate per response (QwQ models benefit from longer context for reasoning)
  top_p: 0.95  # Nucleus sampling threshold
  top_k: 40  # Top-k sampling parameter

# Sampling configuration
sampling:
  n_responses: 5  # Number of responses to sample per problem
  max_retries: 3  # Maximum retries for failed API calls
  timeout: 120.0  # Timeout in seconds (longer for reasoning models)

# Dataset configuration
dataset:
  name: "math500"  # MATH-500 dataset

# Prompt formatting
prompt:
  formatter: "math"  # Use math formatter optimized for math problems
  system_prompt: "You are a mathematical reasoning expert. Solve the following problem step by step, showing all your work and reasoning clearly."
  include_cot_prompt: true  # Include chain-of-thought instruction

# Output configuration
output:
  save_dir: "experiments/results"  # Directory to save results
  save_format: "jsonl"  # Format: jsonl for easier streaming and processing
